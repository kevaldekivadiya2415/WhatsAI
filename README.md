# AI WhatsApp Bot with Meta Cloud API and OpenAI

This guide will help you build a WhatsApp bot using the Meta (formerly Facebook) Cloud API with pure Python, specifically leveraging FastAPI. The bot will integrate webhook events for real-time message reception and use OpenAI to generate AI responses.

## Phases Information

### Phase 1 (Completed): Text-Based Conversation with GPT Model

- Handle only text-based conversations with the GPT model.
- The model responds to individual questions without considering previous conversation history.
- Each interaction is treated as a standalone query.

### Phase 2: Envisioned Improvements

#### Anticipated Enhancements:

- **Support for Multiple Media Formats:**
  - Extend the bot's capabilities to handle various media formats such as images and audio.
  - Allow users to interact with the bot using multimedia content.

- **Multilingual Support:**
  - Enhance the bot's language capabilities to support communication in multiple languages.
  - Provide a seamless experience for users regardless of their preferred language.

- **Conversation Memory:**
  - Implement a mechanism to remember and consider past conversations.
  - Enable the bot to maintain context and continuity in interactions.

These planned enhancements aim to make the WhatsApp bot more versatile, user-friendly, and capable of handling a broader range of user queries and interactions.
